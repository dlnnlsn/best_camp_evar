\begin{enumerate}
	\item 
	\textit{Given $5$ positive real numbers, show that there exist two of them,
	$a$ and $b$, for which \[0 \leq \frac{a}{1+a^2} - \frac{b}{1+b^2} \leq \frac{1}{8}.\]}
	
	
		
	\item 
	\textit{An acute-angled triangle $ABC$ is given. Points $D$, $E$, and $F$ lie
	on the sides $BC$, $CA$, and $AB$ respectively, and satisfy $\angle
	FDE = \angle BAC$. and $\angle DEF = \angle ABC$. Prove that the
	orthocenter of triangle $DEF$ coincides with the circumcenter of
	triangle $ABC$.}
	
	
	
	\item
	\textit{Prove that for every prime $p$, there exists an integer $x$ such that \[x^8 \equiv 16 \pmod p.\]}
	Assume that $p$ is a prime such that no integer $x$ satisfies $p \mid x^8-16$. Note that $p$ is odd, since otherwise $p=2$ and $x=0$ would be a solution. So for each integer $x$, \[p \nmid x^8-16 = (x^4-4)(x^4+4) = (x^2-2)(x^2+2) (x^2-2x+2)(x^2+2x+2)\] \[\iff p \nmid x^2-2,\quad p \nmid x^2+2,\quad p \nmid x^2-2x+2,\quad \text{and} \quad p \nmid x^2+2x+2.\]
	Since these four relations hold for all values of $x$, the first two give that $2$ and $-2$ are not quadratic residues modulo $p$. Thus $-1$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$. However, since $p \nmid x^2-2x+2 = (x-1)^2+1$ for all integer $x$, $-1$ is not a quadratic residue modulo $p$. This is a contradiction, and so no such $p$ exists.
	
	\item 
	\textit{Let $n > 3$ be an integer. John and Mary play the following game: First John labels the sides of a regular $n$-gon with the numbers $1, 2, \dotsc, n$ in whatever order he wants, using each number exactly once. Then Mary divides this $n$-gon into triangles by drawing $n − 3$ diagonals which do not intersect each other inside the n-gon. All these diagonals are labeled with number 1. Into each of the triangles the product of the numbers on its sides is written. Let $S$ be the sum of those $n − 2$ products.}
	
	\textit{Determine the value of $S$ if Mary wants the number $S$ to be as small as possible and John wants $S$ to be as large as possible and if they both make the best possible choices.}
