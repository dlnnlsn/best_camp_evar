\begin{enumerate}
	\item 
	\textit{For an integer $N>0$, $N$ boys, no two of them having the same height, are arranged in a circle. A boy in the given arrangement is said to be \emph{tall} if he is taller than both of his neighbours; a boy is said to be \emph{short} if he is shorter than both of his neighbours. Prove that the number of tall boys in the circle is equal to the number of short boys in the circle.}
	
	
		
	\item 
	\textit{Nonzero real numbers $a,b,c,d$ satisfy the equations \[a+b+c+d = 0, \qquad \frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}+\frac{1}{d}+\frac{1}{abcd} = 0.\]
	Find all possible values of the product $(ab-cd)(c+d)$.}
	
	
	
	\item
	\textit{Find all primes $p$ such that $5^p +4p^4$ is the square of an integer.}
	
	
	
	\item 
	\textit{$ABCD$ is a cyclic quadrilateral. Let the circle $\Gamma_1$ pass through $A$ and $B$ and touch $CD$ at $E$; let the circle $\Gamma_2$ pass through $B$ and $C$ and touch $DA$ at $F$; let the circle $\Gamma_3$ pass through $C$ and $D$ and touch $AB$ at $G$; and let the circle $\Gamma_4$ pass through $D$ and $A$ and touch $BC$ at $H$. Prove that $EG \perp FH$.}
	
	
	
	\item
	\textit{Given a polynomial $P$ with positive real coefficients, prove that $P(1)P(xy) \geq P(x)P(y)$ for all $x,y \geq 1$.}
