\begin{enumerate}
	\item 
	Determine all positive integers $k$ and $n$ satisfying the equation $$k^2 - 2016 = 3^n.$$
	
		
	\item 
	Let $ABC$ be an acute angled triangle. Let $H$ be the foot of the altitude from $C$ onto $AB$. Suppose that $|AH|=3|BH|$. Let $M$ and $N$ be the midpoints of the segments $AB$ and $AC$ respectively. Let $P$ be a point such that $|NP|=|NC|$ and $|CP|=|CB|$ and such that $B$ and $P$ lie on opposite sides of the line $AC$. Show that $\angle APM = \angle PBA$.\\
	
	\item 
	
	Consider a $4 \times 4$ grid of unit squares. How many ways are there to write a 0 or 1 in each $1 \times 1$ square so that the product of the two numbers written on every neighbouring pair of squares (sharing a common edge) is always 0?\\	
	\smallskip
	
	\item 
	
	Find all functions $f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ satisfying $$f(xy-1)+f(x)f(y) = 2xy - 1$$ for all $x,y \in \mathbb{R}$.\\
	
%%	\item 
%%	Find all triplets $(x,y,z)$ of positive integers satisfying $1+4^x + 4^y = z^2$.
	
	\item
	
	Find all infinite sequences $a_1, a_2, a_3 \dots $ of positive integers such that
	\begin{itemize}
	\item [(a)] $a_{mn} = a_ma_n$ for all positive integers $m$ and $n$, and
	\item [(b)] there are infinitely many positive integers $n$ such that $$\{1, 2, \dots, n\} = \{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \}.$$
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\item Find the largest integer $n$ satisfying the following conditions:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $n^2$ can be expressed as the difference of two cubes;
		\item $2n+79$ is a perfect square.
	\end{enumerate}

\item If $x$ and $y$ are rational numbers such that $x^5+y^5=2x^2y^2$, prove that $1-xy$ is the square of a rational number.
